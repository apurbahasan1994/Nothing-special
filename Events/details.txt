run code upon certain events

--> node js ---> on('name',event=>{})
--> browser ---> addEventListener('name',(event)=>)

<--------- broser events options-------->

                  Event

         MoseEvent      DragEvent    ....
         coordinates    extra data
         event target   event target

The events object : 

event bubling ---> dom events ===> bubling and capturing

the capturing phase goes from outside to inside 
so the thing is if we made a event listener for The
capturing phase of the parent elements than the browser 
will check for the event in the parent also for the capturing phase 


the bubling phase does the opposite, it goes from the 
inside to the outside. 
all events we listen with addEventListener triggers
in the bubling phase.
so the childs event listener will trigger first than the parents
event listener will trigger second

---- to stop the other event listeners on the same element 
event.stopImmidiatePropagation()


--- event delegation
